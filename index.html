        <h2>About the Institution</h2>
        <p>SRM Institute of Science and Technology (formerly known as
            SRM University) is one of the top-ranking Universities and
            most premier engineering destinations in India, which was
            established in 1985 by the Founder Chancellor, Dr. T. R.
            Paarivendhar. Now it is functioning in five campuses located
            at Kattankulathur, Vadapalani, Tiruchirappalli, Ramapuram
            and Baburayanpettai in Tamilnadu, Modi Nagar in
            Ghaziabad with over 70,000 students and 3945 faculty
            members. SRMIST is accredited by NAAC with ‘A++’;
            Grade. SRM Institute of Science and Technology has been
            awarded a Four-Star rating by Quacquarelli Symonds (‘QS’),
            a leading global higher education company.

        <h2>About the Program</h2>
        <p>In the contemporary digital landscape and looking ahead
            into the future, the research in Microwave and Optical
            communication technologies play a pivotal role in
            shaping the way people connect, communicate, and
            conduct business. Microwave communication has been a
            cornerstone for long-distance data transmission, while
            Optical communication, with its high bandwidth
            capabilities, has become integral for the rapid exchange
            of vast amounts of data. Their operation spectrum has
            been triggered by recent technologies such as millimeterwave, 5G, beyond 5G, 6G, Terahertz (THz),
            metamaterials, beamforming, fiber optic sensing,
            satellite-optical remote sensing, under-water laser
            communication, photonic integration, artificial
            intelligence, etc., and has received tremendous response
            from both researcher and user community. Specifically,
            the recent deployment of 5G technology in India and the
            research requirement of beyond 5G technology under the
            Make in Inda flagship scheme of GOI, necessitates
            adequate expertise in the areas of Microwave and Optics.
            Additionally, optical remote sensing and under water
            communication, which plays crucial role in environment
            and security, also require tremendous research expertise.
            These technical advancements align seamlessly with
            India’s ‘Digital India’ and ‘Innovate India’ initiatives,
            accelerating the nation’s journey towards becoming a
            knowledge-driven economy. This proposed event will
            predominantly focus on the current status and future
            development of Microwave and Optical Technologies in
            India and world.

        <h2>About the Department</h2>
        <p>The Department of Electronics and Communication
            Engineering (ECE) was established in 1991. It offers
            undergraduate programs (4 years), postgraduate programs (2
            years), an integrated M.Tech program (5 years), and doctoral
            programs. B.Tech in Electronics and Communication
            Engineering is one of the leading undergraduate programs at
            the SRM Institute of Science and Technology, with a
            distinction for scientific rigor and development. This program
            is accredited by NBA and the Engineering Accreditation
            Commission (EAC) of ABET, USA (https://www.abet.org).
            The department features well-equipped facilities, especially the
            Center for Electronics Skill Development (CESD), which has
            an anechoic chamber for antenna characterization. The
            department has strong collaborations with industries and
            reputed institutes like the Central Electronics Engineering
            Research Institute, National Instruments, Samsung, CoreEL
            Technologies, Entuple Technologies (Synopsys), and
            Optithought. The department has signed a MoU with New
            Age Instruments, Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR)
            Malaysia, the Electronics Sector Skills Council of India
            (ESSCI), Nano-Academic Technologies Inc., Canada,
            Impulse Technology, Haryana, India, and Numergion PVT
            LTD, Pune for the joint product development and skill
            development of students and faculties. It has received
            significant research grants from DST under FIST, AICTE,
            DRDO, BRNS, ISRO, UGC, and SERB. The prestigious
            Visvesvaraya PhD scheme for Electronics and IT from Meity,
            GOl, is granted to full-time and part time research scholars.
            The faculty members of the ECE department are versatile in
            many diversified fields. They have good research potential,
            with 2254 research articles published in both Scopus and SCIindexed journals and 84 published patents and 38 granted to
            their credentials.
